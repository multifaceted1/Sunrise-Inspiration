                <li>Keep in mind all that our mothers have done for us.  For example, if our mother's didn't eat enough calcium when they were pregnant with us, then they gave us the calcium from their own bones.</li>

        <h2><b>A Productive Day</b></h2>
        <p>What would you like to produce today?</p>
        <p>That is the first thing to know.</p>
        <p> Do you need to complete alot at work? Be sure to get up and move around a little.  It will increase the circulation in your legs and make you feel more alert.</p>
        <p>Do you have something unpleasant that needs to be done?  There is no use putting it off. You may as well get it over with.  You will feel so much better when that is off your mind.</p>
        <p>Is there a creative project you are working on? That sounds like something fun and productive.  Do a few minutes of daydreaming to brainstorm and consider making a chart or drawing to make your project outline more clear.</p>
        <p>Do you need to organize any old drawers or paperwork?</p>
        <p>Do you want to call any family members today?</p>
